# Modulant

Modulant allows for the creation of images and their sonification.

The present implementation is built upon image-importing and freehand-drawing modules that may be used to create arbitrary visual scenes (and eerie sounds), with more constrained functional and typographical modules in development.

The audio engine is inspired by a 1940â€™s synthesizer, the ANS, that scans across images. In this scanning, one axis is time and the other axis is frequency. Modulant thus becomes a graphical space to be explored sonically and vice-versa. The project is built with Processing for graphics and interaction, and Ruby & Puredata for sound.



## Usage

The early Modulant has a very plain and minimalist interface, geared toward fast switching between its modes.

The application responds to keyboard shortcuts which select various drawing modes or execute commands. The pointer/mouse is only used for drawing.

Here is the current list of keybindings:

### Bindings for Drawing
    r       rectangle mode 
    t       triangle mode 
    e       ellipse mode 
    f       freehand mode 
    d       freehand w/ dots 
    Shift-c clear all 
    Ctrl-z  undo 
    Ctrl-y  redo 

### Sonification Control
    Space                  resume/pause scanning 
    Left/Right             step 1px 
    Ctrl-Left/Right        step 10px 
    Shift-Ctrl-Left/Right  step 50px 
    m                      mute/unmute sound 
    g                      toggle grid;

### File Operations 
    Ctrl-o  load background image 
    Ctrl-s  save work buffer as image 
 
### Colours 
    0         black (eraser) 
    1:8       Solarized base colours 
    Ctrl-1:8  Solarized accents 
    9         white

### Help
    h  toggle help (this text)

See this [short guide on installing libraries](http://www.learningprocessing.com/tutorials/libraries/) for the where and how if you are not sure.

## Tips

- Images that you load to sonify should have light features on dark backgrounds. The brightness of each pixel determines the volume of the associated oscillator -- if the majority of your image is bright, then all you're going to hear is a loud and harsh noise.

- Also, when drawing, it's better to avoid bright and long vertical lines/regions -- these will turn on a lot of oscillators in one go, which may sound unpleasant (unless you know what you're doing).
